  Abstract                 = {A mathematical model for the assessment of hemodynamic parameters using quantitative echocardiography is presented. The method involves the intravenous injection of an ultrasonic echo contrast agent. The relative enhancement of the backscattered ultrasound intensity is measured as a function of time (the time-intensity curve). From this measurement, the volume flow rate (cardiac output) and the mixing volume are calculated. Relevant acoustic properties of the ultrasound contrast agent are discussed. An in vitro experiment is performed to corroborate the theory presented.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine the effect of contrast medium injection rate and biphasic versus uniphasic bolus on hepatic parenchymal enhancement at computed tomography (CT), 105 patients were randomized into four protocols. Hepatic and aortic enhancement curves were measured for each protocol. The optimal scanning interval (the duration between onset of a desired hepatic enhancement threshold and decline of enhancement below the threshold or onset of the equilibrium phase) and contrast enhancement index (CEI) (area under the hepatic enhancement curve above a desired threshold during the nonequilibrium phase) were the primary determinants of merit. Measurements were performed at hepatic enhancement thresholds between 10 and 60 HU. At most thresholds of hepatic enhancement, optimal scanning intervals were significantly longer and CEIs were significantly higher for the biphasic protocols than for the uniphasic protocols (P < .03). A biphasic injection with a high initial flow rate produces high peak contrast enhancement but delayed onset of equilibrium and thus provides a longer optimal scanning interval.},

The scientific program included an historical perspective and a discussion of the clinical relevance of water-fat MRI, a technical description of multiecho pulse sequences, a review of data acquisition and reconstruction algorithms, a summary of the confounding factors that influence quantitative fat measurements and the importance of MRI-based biomarkers, a description of applications in the heart, liver, pancreas, abdomen, spine, pelvis, and muscles, an overview of the implications of fat in diabetes and obesity, a discussion on MR spectroscopy, a review of childhood obesity, the efficacy of lifestyle interventional studies, and the role of brown adipose tissue, and an outlook on federal funding opportunities from the National Institutes of Health.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Advanced neoplasia represents the primary target for colorectal-cancer screening and prevention. We compared the diagnostic yield from parallel computed tomographic colonography (CTC) and optical colonoscopy (OC) screening programs. Methods We compared primary CTC screening in 3120 consecutive adults (mean [{+/-}SD] age, 57.0{+/-}7.2 years) with primary OC screening in 3163 consecutive adults (mean age, 58.1{+/-}7.8 years). The main outcome measures included the detection of advanced neoplasia (advanced adenomas and carcinomas) and the total number of harvested polyps. Referral for polypectomy during OC was offered for all CTC-detected polyps of at least 6 mm in size. Patients with one or two small polyps (6 to 9 mm) also were offered the option of CTC surveillance. During primary OC, nearly all detected polyps were removed, regardless of size, according to established practice guidelines. Results During CTC and OC screening, 123 and 121 advanced neoplasms were found, including 14 and 4 invasive cancers, respectively. The referral rate for OC in the primary CTC screening group was 7.9\% (246 of 3120 patients). Advanced neoplasia was confirmed in 100 of the 3120 patients in the CTC group (3.2\%) and in 107 of the 3163 patients in the OC group (3.4\%), not including 158 patients with 193 unresected CTC-detected polyps of 6 to 9 mm who were undergoing surveillance. The total numbers of polyps removed in the CTC and OC groups were 561 and 2434, respectively. There were seven colonic perforations in the OC group and none in the CTC group. Conclusions Primary CTC and OC screening strategies resulted in similar detection rates for advanced neoplasia, although the numbers of polypectomies and complications were considerably smaller in the CTC group. These findings support the use of CTC as a primary screening test before therapeutic OC. },

  Abstract                 = {Quantification of hepatic steatosis is a significant unmet need for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). MRI is capable of separating water and fat signals in order to quantify fatty infiltration of the liver (hepatic steatosis). Unfortunately, fat signal has confounding T(1) effects and the nonzero mean noise in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) magnitude images can lead to incorrect estimation of the true lipid percentage. In this study, the effects of bias from T(1) effects and image noise were investigated. An oil/water phantom with volume fat-fractions ranging linearly from 0\% to 100\% was designed and validated using a spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequence in combination with a chemical-shift based fat-water separation method known as iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least squares estimation (IDEAL). We demonstrated two approaches to reduce the effects of T(1): small flip angle (flip angle) and dual flip angle methods. Both methods were shown to effectively minimize deviation of the measured fat-fraction from its true value. We also demonstrated two methods to reduce noise bias: magnitude discrimination and phase-constrained reconstruction. Both methods were shown to reduce this noise bias effectively from 15\% to less than 1\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Developing on-board automotive driver assistance systems aiming to alert drivers about driving environments, and possible collision with other vehicles has attracted a lot of attention lately. In these systems, robust and reliable vehicle detection is a critical step. This paper presents a review of recent vision-based on-road vehicle detection systems. Our focus is on systems where the camera is mounted on the vehicle rather than being fixed such as in traffic/driveway monitoring systems. First, we discuss the problem of on-road vehicle detection using optical sensors followed by a brief review of intelligent vehicle research worldwide. Then, we discuss active and passive sensors to set the stage for vision-based vehicle detection. Methods aiming to quickly hypothesize the location of vehicles in an image as well as to verify the hypothesized locations are reviewed next. Integrating detection with tracking is also reviewed to illustrate the benefits of exploiting temporal continuity for vehicle detection. Finally, we present a critical overview of the methods discussed, we assess their potential for future deployment, and we present directions for future research.},
